Computer Science can be hard some times. At those moments this repository comes to the rescue! 

Welcome to ***The CSUTH University Project*** . Here you will find solutions for both common and sophisticated excercises that are made to train you on how to be the next top Developer / Software or Hardware Engineer / Programmer. Most of the excercises that are solved in this repository are from the *Computer Science Department of University of Thessaly* and solved by me personaly, a student of this University. 

## Getting Started

### !!!Warning!!! 
Try to remember that these excercises are solved mostly by me, an Undergraduate Student (at the time of writing) as well. As such a lot of the solutions might not be optimal and a lot of times the code can be improved. At the same time remember that you study Computer Science. We are on a field that there is never "just one solution". So if your solution doesn't much mine, but still works, then it is still an acceptable solution!

Oh, also, since i mentioned the "still works"... some of the solutions that you see here could actually be incorrect! **Excercises seen here are not verified by my professors**! So keep an eye out, will ya?

### Language

Please keep in mind that most of the excercises and solutions that are shared here are from the *Computer Science Department of University of Thessaly*!
As such, some parts of this repository are written in **English** while others in **Greek**!
